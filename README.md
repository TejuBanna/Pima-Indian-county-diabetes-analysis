# Pima-Indian-county-diabetes-analysis
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

# Diabetes Prediction Dataset

This repository contains a dataset for predicting the onset of diabetes using medical predictor variables. The dataset includes various features such as the number of pregnancies, BMI, insulin level, age, and more, with the target variable being whether or not the patient has diabetes (Outcome).

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes several medical predictor variables and one target variable, `Outcome`, which indicates whether the patient has diabetes or not. The predictor variables are as follows:

- Number of pregnancies
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Insulin level
- Age
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- DPF
- Outcome
      
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a patient has diabetes based on these medical indicators.
